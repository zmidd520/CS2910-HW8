I enjoyed working with the mix of HTML and Javascript that creates React's JSX syntax. It's cool to see how Javascript can be used to update the DOM without using the browser console.

There wasn't really anything in particular that I disliked, I'm still getting used to Javascript, so writing it in any capcity still throws me for a bit of a loop, but this
assignment helped me feel a little more comfortable with JS.

As for something entertaining: wild rabbits in my neighborhood have now caused my car's check engine light to come on 3 times in the last month-ish. Apparently electrical wiring that is vital to the well-being and safe operation of the vehicle makes a great chew toy. Thankfully, nothing has blown up (yet) and I have been warning-light free for 2 days now.
